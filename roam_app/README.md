## Motivation and Features
The Roam Activity Tracker was created as a portfolio project in the Flatiron School's Full Stack Software Engineering program.  The goal was to fully apply my understanding of Ruby on Rails by creating a complex web app. This repository is Version 2 of the Roam app that adds some redundant functionality to showcase my skills in JavaScript on top of the existing Ruby on Rails structure.  The Roam Activity Tracker allows users to track outdoor activities, such as hikes, bike rides, and kayaking trips, that are added by other system users, add these activities to their "To Do List", and track the date and time of specific trips.  The User index page, user show pages, and "Log a Trip" form are all rendered using JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.

This project allowed me to expand my knowledge of Rails and JavaScript through complex object relationships while adding other features such as bcrypt and Omniauth.  I was also able to expand my skills using AJAX, JSON, and JavaScript Model Objects.
